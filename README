	Computer bot is a prototype bot platform. 
	
		Its objective is to explore the marriage of Empowered People, 
		Web 2.0 (APIs, Mashups, Social), Personal Management Information Systems and Robots.
	
		Computer bot / Twitter edition is a proof of concept application.
		Twitter users get an enhanced Twitter IM Bot.
		Tweeting developers get a customizable, extendable, prototype IM Bot platform.
	
	
	Some quick notes to get you started
	-------
	
		Computer bot is a ruby program that requires several RubyGems.

		You need Ruby (tested with 1.8.5 on Mac OS X and Linux) and to install 
		the following gems before running Computer bot:

			sudo gem install daemons
			sudo gem install xmpp4r-simple
			sudo gem install jabber-bot
			sudo gem install json

		Twitter edition requires you to install the following gem:
		
			sudo gem install twitter4r


	Configuration
	------
	
		Edit and rename 
			lib/config/config-sample.yml 
		to 
			lib/config/config.yml
	
		Enter your bot's Jabber credentials (you can ask me for @webcracy.org accounts).
		
		If you're on Dreamhost, you must specify a resource with your jib, as such:
			you@yourserveratdreamhost.com/resource
		
		Example:
			computerbot@yourdomain.com/Bot
		
		Enter your Jabber ID (ex: you@gmail.com) as "master". (Dreamhosters: No need for a resource here)
		Enter your bot's Status message, for example "Computer ready."
		
		Enter your Twitter credentials.
		
		
	Running the bot
	-------
	
		To run the bot, type:
	
			ruby computerbot.rb start
	
		To stop the bot, type:
		
			ruby computerbot.rb stop
			
	
	Operating the bot
	-------
	
		If your config is right, the bot will send you a message saying it's available.
		
		Send "help" to the bot to see all available commands.
		
		User and Developer documentation is being progressively made available at:
